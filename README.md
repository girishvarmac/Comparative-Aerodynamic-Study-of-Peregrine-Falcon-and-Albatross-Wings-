# Comparative Aerodynamic Study of Peregrine Falcon and Albatross Wings

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a **comparative aerodynamic analysis of two bird wing configurations** – the **Peregrine Falcon** and the **Albatross** – with the aim of understanding natural adaptations for high-speed maneuvers vs. long-endurance gliding.  
The study integrates **theoretical methods, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and literature-based insights** to evaluate aerodynamic efficiency, lift–drag performance, and flow characteristics.
