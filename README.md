# Comparative Aerodynamic Study of Peregrine Falcon and Albatross Wings

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This repository contains the presentation and report from a **literature survey** comparing the aerodynamic characteristics of **Peregrine Falcon** and **Albatross** wings.  
The aim was to study how nature optimizes wing geometry for two contrasting requirements:  
- **High-speed diving and maneuverability** (Peregrine Falcon)  
- **Efficient long-distance gliding** (Albatross)  

## ðŸ“– Scope of the Survey
- Reviewed research papers on bird flight aerodynamics and bio-inspired wing design.  
- Analyzed differences in **aspect ratio, wing loading, and liftâ€“drag characteristics**.  
- Summarized how wing geometry influences performance at different Reynolds numbers.  
- Discussed implications for **bio-inspired UAV design**.  

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- **Falcon wings** are short and tapered â†’ generate leading-edge vortices for lift enhancement during dives.  
- **Albatross wings** are long and slender â†’ reduce induced drag, enabling dynamic soaring and endurance flight.  
- Both designs show evolutionary optimization for specific flight missions.
